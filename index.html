										<h2>Establishing a website is easy when you work with someone who cares about the results</h2>
										</header>
									<p>I was working at my first corporate job a few years ago and I was stoked. However, I was finding some of the work initially complicated, everyone around me had been in their jobs for decades and sometimes they didn’t know how to convey a process to me. I began taking copious notes on how to do things so that whoever came into the team next wouldn’t have such a hard time. Then they started an operational excellence program and I was chosen to work with the devs to automate processes since I had all this documentation for them. Once I saw how much easier they were able to make my job, I fell totally in love with Software Engineering. How could you not love making things better for people?!</p>
