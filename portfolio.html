									<p>All small businesses begin with hope. Reinforcing your dreams with steadfast business decisions is how you create your dream job. Becoming easily accessible to your potential customers is becoming a step closer to booking with them. Taking Liv's botique cake business to the next level was an honor.</p>

										<h3>Jouhari + Kehl Wedding</h3>
									</header>
									<p>Weddings are one of the most important events that a family will ever put together. Lacking communication during planning is one of the quickest ways to sour a beautiful time. Harnessing a website is becoming more and more commonplace for weddings, and I was thrilled to take big one thing off of their to-do list.</p>

													<h3>My Decision to Develop: Passion for Tech & People </h3>
												</header>
												<p>I realized that I could be building and learning more, and quit my line-cook job in 2019. After learning and nailing down what it was that I loved about tech, I knew that I wanted to start by building beautiful, effective websites. Since then I have doggedly followed web development and software engineering as a whole. It has been incredibly rewarding, as are many things that require true, hard work.</p><p> I am consistently amazed that I can do what I love for others. Cincinnati is a beautiful city, to me. We are hard workers here, and we are friendly. We are tough, and we are interested in growth. So many incredible professionals have crossed my path already and I am only gearing up to meet more. I cannot properly convey how grateful and inspired I am.</p> <p>Giving back is important, and I have begun to volunteer for CincyTechiesForGood and directly for St. Vincent de Paul. To help those that do good for others is a wonderful thing, I feel like my efforts are going directly to supporting people on the ground who are changing the city for the better.</p>
